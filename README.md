# Tree-Vs-Bubble-Sort
This Java program provides a comparison between a binary tree traversal algorithm and bubble sort.
 This code outputs the results of both algorithms, including the number of comparisons made during their execution. It appears that binary tree sort is more efficient than bubble sort in terms of the number of comparisons made; however, in terms of memory usage, bubble sort is more efficient than a binary tree.
